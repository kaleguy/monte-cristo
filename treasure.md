### Acts of Charity
Despite his dark purpose, the Count also:

### The Irony
The treasure that enables revenge also:

- Becomes a burden rather than a blessing
- Cannot buy peace or happiness

## Symbolism of the Treasure

### Power and Corruption
- Absolute wealth gives absolute power
- Power enables both good and evil
- Money cannot buy redemption
- Wealth isolates as much as it empowers

### Providence and Fate
- The treasure seems like divine providence
- Enables the Count to be "God's instrument"
- But also enables his hubris
- Questions whether it was blessing or curse

### Transformation

- From sailor to aristocrat
- From victim to avenger
- But at the cost of his original self

## Final Disposition

At the novel's end:
- Some wealth spent on revenge
- Some given to Morrel family
- Valentine and Maximilian receive fortune
- The Count keeps enough to live on
- Leaves with Haydée to start new life

## Legacy

The treasure of Monte Cristo represents:
- The power of knowledge (Faria's gift)
- The danger of unlimited power
- The cost of transformation
- The impossibility of returning to innocence
- Both salvation and damnation

As Abbé Faria said: "Knowledge is power, and power is the greatest treasure of all."
