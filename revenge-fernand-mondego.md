# The Revenge Against Fernand Mondego (Count de Morcerf)

## The Crime

Fernand Mondego was:
- Dantès' rival for the love of Mercédès
- Conspired with Danglars to frame Dantès
- Delivered the treacherous letter to the authorities
- Later married Mercédès after Dantès was imprisoned

## Fernand's Rise

After betraying Dantès, Fernand:
- Joined the French army
- Served under Ali Pasha in Greece
- Betrayed Ali Pasha for money and advancement
- Returned to France with a fortune
- Became Count de Morcerf
- Rose to the rank of General
- Became a French peer

## The Count's Strategy

### Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering
- Learns of Fernand's betrayal of Ali Pasha
- Discovers Fernand sold Ali Pasha's wife and daughter into slavery
- Brings Haydée (Ali Pasha's daughter) to Paris as his ward

### Phase 2: Public Exposure
- Anonymous letters to newspapers questioning Morcerf's honor
- Chamber of Peers investigation into Morcerf's military service
- Haydée testifies before the Chamber, revealing Morcerf's treachery
- Produces documents proving Morcerf's betrayal

### Phase 3: Total Destruction
- Morcerf is stripped of his titles and honors
- His son Albert learns the truth and abandons him
- Mercédès discovers everything and leaves him
- Publicly disgraced and alone

## The Result

Fernand Mondego, now utterly ruined and alone, confronts the Count. Learning that the Count is Edmond Dantès, Fernand returns home and commits suicide.

## Collateral Damage

- **Mercédès**: Loses everything and must start over in poverty
- **Albert de Morcerf**: His future destroyed, must rebuild his life
- Both innocents suffer for Fernand's crimes
