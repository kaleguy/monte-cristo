# The Revenge of The Count of Monte Cristo

## Overview

After discovering the treasure on the island of Monte Cristo, Edmond Dantès transforms himself into the wealthy and mysterious Count of Monte Cristo. With unlimited resources and a new identity, he methodically executes his revenge against those who wronged him and destroyed his life.

## The Three Main Targets

1. **Fernand Mondego (Count de Morcerf)** - The man who betrayed him out of jealousy for Mercédès
2. **Baron Danglars** - The man who wrote the treacherous letter that led to his imprisonment
3. **Gérard de Villefort** - The ambitious prosecutor who buried evidence and condemned him to protect his own career

## The Journey

- **Years in Prison**: 14 years in the Château d'If
- **Escape**: 1829
- **Discovery of Treasure**: 1829, on the island of Monte Cristo
- **Return to Society**: 1838, as the Count of Monte Cristo
- **Period of Revenge**: 1838-1844

## The Method

The Count's revenge is not simple violence but elaborate psychological warfare. He uses his wealth, intelligence, and patience to orchestrate the complete downfall of each enemy, targeting not just them but their families, reputations, and fortunes.

## Key Principles

- **Divine Justice**: The Count sees himself as an instrument of Providence
- **Precision**: Each revenge is tailored to the specific crime committed
- **Patience**: Years of planning and positioning
- **Collateral Damage**: Innocents often suffer, leading to the Count's eventual moral crisis
