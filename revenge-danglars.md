# The Revenge Against Baron Danglars

## The Crime

Danglars was:
- Supercargo on the Pharaon (Dantès was captain)
- Jealous of Dantès' promotion and success
- Wrote the treacherous letter denouncing Dantès as a Bonapartist conspirator
- Primary architect of the plot against Dantès

## Danglars' Rise

After betraying Dantès, Danglars:
- Married the widow of a wealthy banker
- Became a successful banker himself
- Accumulated an enormous fortune
- Became Baron Danglars
- Rose to prominence in Parisian society

## The Count's Strategy

### Phase 1: Financial Manipulation
- Opens an unlimited credit account at Danglars' bank
- Uses the account to inspire confidence, then undermine it
- Manipulates stock markets and commodities
- Creates artificial financial crises

### Phase 2: Systematic Destruction
- Causes Danglars to lose 1 million francs on the telegraph speculation
- Arranges the default of his Spanish investments (3 million francs)
- Orchestrates the bankruptcy of the Hospital bond scheme (hundreds of thousands)
- Drains away money through various schemes involving the Count's associates

### Phase 3: The Final Blow
- Encourages Danglars to flee with 5 million francs
- Arranges for Danglars to be captured by Luigi Vampa's bandits in Italy
- Vampa holds Danglars prisoner, charging exorbitant amounts for food
- Danglars is forced to spend all his remaining money just to eat

### Phase 4: Ultimate Humiliation
- When completely ruined, the Count visits Danglars in captivity
- Reveals his true identity as Edmond Dantès
- Danglars' hair turns white from the shock and horror
- The Count releases him with only 50,000 francs to live on

## The Result

Baron Danglars, once worth millions, is left virtually penniless and broken. His vast fortune is destroyed, his reputation ruined, and he is left to live in poverty and shame.

## Collateral Damage

- **Madame Danglars (Hermione)**: Her reputation is damaged, though she survives financially due to her own schemes
- **Eugénie Danglars**: Their daughter's arranged marriage is destroyed, though this actually frees her
- Numerous investors and creditors who lose money in Danglars' collapse
