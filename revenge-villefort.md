# The Revenge Against Gérard de Villefort

## The Crime

Villefort was:
- The deputy crown prosecutor in Marseilles
- Ambitious and ruthless in his pursuit of power
- Discovered Dantès was carrying a letter to his father (a Bonapartist)
- Burned the evidence and condemned Dantès to silence him
- Sent Dantès to the Château d'If without trial to protect his own career

## Villefort's Rise

After betraying Dantès, Villefort:
- Married Renée de Saint-Méran (first wife, died)
- Became Royal Prosecutor in Paris
- Married Héloïse de Villefort (second wife)
- Had two children: Valentine (with Renée) and Édouard (with Héloïse)
- Rose to become one of the most powerful men in France

## The Count's Strategy

### Phase 1: Psychological Warfare
- Reveals knowledge of Villefort's buried past
- Hints at knowing about the illegitimate child Villefort tried to bury alive
- Resurrects Benedetto (the "buried" child) as Andrea Cavalcanti
- Introduces "Andrea" into Parisian society

### Phase 2: Family Destruction
- Héloïse de Villefort begins poisoning family members for inheritance
- Valentine is in line to inherit the Saint-Méran fortune
- The Count manipulates events so suspicion falls on the Villefort household
- Multiple deaths occur: Saint-Méran grandparents, the servant Barrois, etc.

### Phase 3: Public Exposure
- Andrea Cavalcanti is engaged to Eugénie Danglars
- At the wedding, Andrea is arrested for murder
- Andrea reveals he is Benedetto - Villefort's illegitimate son
- In court, Benedetto publicly exposes Villefort's attempt to bury him alive
- Villefort's entire secret past is revealed

### Phase 4: Final Devastation
- Héloïse poisons herself and their son Édouard
- Valentine (whom the Count loves and protects) nearly dies but is saved
- Villefort, discovering his wife and son dead, goes insane
- The Count reveals his identity as Edmond Dantès

## The Result

Villefort loses everything:
- His reputation destroyed by public scandal
- His career ended
- His wife and son dead by murder-suicide
- His mind broken - he goes completely insane
- Found digging in his garden, searching for the body of his "buried" son

## Collateral Damage

This revenge causes the most innocent suffering:
- **Valentine de Villefort**: Nearly murdered, loses her entire family
- **Édouard de Villefort**: An innocent child, murdered by his mother
- **Madame Saint-Méran and Monsieur Saint-Méran**: Poisoned
- **Barrois**: The faithful servant, poisoned
- **Héloïse de Villefort**: Driven to murder and suicide

The Count himself recognizes he has gone too far and begins to question his mission of vengeance.
